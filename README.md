# RestApp

Restaurant template

Here is a basic template of a Restaurant Delivery App. The design was getted from Figma and I implemented the UI in React Native (Expo).

You can run the project by going to the folder where cloned and running

`npm i`

`expo start`

Down here are some photos and a video of the UI
